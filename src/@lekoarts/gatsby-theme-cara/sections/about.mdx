## A few words about me

I am originally from Brno, Czech Republic and moved to Portland, Oregon, in 2016.

Two years later my wife <a href="https://www.christyleezilka.com" target="_blank">Christy</a> and I returned to Brno,
where I gained most of my experience as a web developer working for FinTech company <a href="https://www.fnz.com" target="_blank">FNZ</a>. Now I am back in Portland and seeking an opportunity that matches my skillset.
