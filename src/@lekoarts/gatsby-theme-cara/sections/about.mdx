## A few words about me

Based in Portland, OR | Originally from Brno, Czech Republic

I moved to Portland in 2016 to pursue new adventures and opportunities. Two years later my <a href="https://www.christyleezilka.com" target="_blank">wife</a> and I returned to Brno,
where I gained most of my experience as a web developer working for FinTech company <a href="https://www.fnz.com" target="_blank">FNZ</a>
. Now I am back in Portland and seeking an opportunity that matches my skillset and
career aspirations.
