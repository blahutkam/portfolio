## A few words about me

I am originally from Czech Republic. For the past six years I am situated in Portland,
Oregon.

In 2018 we took some time away from our Portland home. We lived in Brno for two years where I gained most of my experience as a web developer working for FinTech company [FNZ](https://www.fnz.com/).
