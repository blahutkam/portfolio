## A few words about me

I am originally from Czech Republic and moved to Portland, Oregon, in 2016.

Two years later my wife [Christy](https://www.christyleezilka.com/) and I returned to Brno, Czech Republic,
where I gained most of my experience as a web developer working for FinTech company
[FNZ](https://www.fnz.com/). Now I am back in Portland and seeking a full-time opportunity working with React library.
